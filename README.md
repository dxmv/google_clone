## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](architecture.drawio.png)

The system follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Client (React Frontend)** - User interface for search queries and results
- **Query API Service (Python FastAPI)** - HTTP gateway with autocomplete and spell correction
- **Search Service (Go)** - Core ranking engine using BM25 with gRPC interface
- **Index Service (Go)** - Builds and maintains the inverted index
- **Crawler (Go)** - Web crawler for content discovery and extraction

**Data Flow:**
1. User queries flow from the frontend ‚Üí Query API ‚Üí Search Service
2. Search Service queries the inverted index (BadgerDB) for fast retrieval
3. Results are enriched with metadata from MongoDB and returned to the user
4. Crawler discovers content, stores raw HTML in Cloudflare R2, and metadata in MongoDB
5. Indexer processes the stored content to build searchable indexes

## Services

Woogle is built as a microservices architecture with five main services, each handling a specific aspect of the search engine pipeline:

### üï∑Ô∏è [Crawler Service](services/crawler/README.md)
**Language**: Go  
**Purpose**: Discovers and fetches Wikipedia pages, extracting content and metadata

- BFS crawling strategy with ~50k page target
- Concurrent worker pool processing
- Dual storage: raw HTML in Cloudflare R2, metadata in MongoDB
- Intelligent URL filtering and deduplication
- Rate limiting and respectful crawling

### üìö [Indexer Service](services/indexer/README.md)
**Language**: Go  
**Purpose**: Builds inverted index from crawled content for fast search retrieval

- Concurrent document processing and tokenization
- BadgerDB storage for high-performance key-value operations
- BM25 statistics calculation (avgDocLen, corpus size)
- Position-aware indexing for phrase queries
- Memory-efficient batch processing

### üîç [Search Service](services/search/README.md)
**Language**: Go + gRPC  
**Purpose**: Core ranking engine providing BM25-based document retrieval

- BM25 algorithm with configurable parameters (k=2.0, b=0.9)
- Concurrent postings retrieval and scoring
- Min-heap optimization for top-K results
- LRU query cache for performance (1000 entries)
- Position-based scoring enhancements

### üåê [Query API Service](services/query-api/README.md)
**Language**: Python + FastAPI  
**Purpose**: HTTP gateway with autocomplete and spell correction

- RESTful search and suggestion endpoints
- SymSpell-powered "Did you mean?" functionality
- Redis-based n-gram autocomplete system

- Performance optimized with Vite

Each service is containerized with Docker and can be scaled independently. The services communicate through well-defined APIs (HTTP/gRPC) and share data through MongoDB, Redis, and Cloudflare R2 storage.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.22+** for crawler and indexer services
- **Docker & Docker Compose** for running the full stack
- **MongoDB** and **Cloudflare R2** credentials (for data storage)

### Step 1: Set Up Environment

First, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dxmv/google_clone
cd google_clone
```

### Step 2: Crawl Pages

The crawler discovers and stores web pages. You'll need to configure your storage credentials first.

1. **Configure environment variables** in `services/crawler/start.sh`:
   ```bash
   export MONGO_CONNECTION='your-mongodb-connection-string'
   export MINIO_ENDPOINT='your-minio-or-r2-endpoint'
   export MINIO_ACCESS_KEY='your-access-key'
   export MINIO_SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
   ```

2. **Run the crawler**:
   ```bash
   cd services/crawler
   chmod +x start.sh
   ./start.sh
   ```

   The crawler will:
   - Start from Wikipedia seed URLs
   - Crawl ~50k pages using BFS
   - Store raw HTML in MinIO/R2
   - Save metadata (title, URL, content length) in MongoDB
   - Take 10-30 minutes depending on your connection

### Step 3: Build Search Index

After crawling, build the inverted index for fast search:

1. **Configure the same environment variables** in `services/indexer/start.sh`

2. **Run the indexer**:
   ```bash
   cd services/indexer
   chmod +x start.sh
   ./start.sh
   ```

   The indexer will:
   - Read crawled pages from storage
   - Build inverted index with term frequencies and positions
   - Store index in BadgerDB for fast retrieval
   - Calculate corpus statistics for BM25 ranking
   - Take 5-15 minutes depending on corpus size

### Step 4: Launch the Search Engine

With your corpus crawled and indexed, start the full search engine:

```bash
# From the project root
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:
- **Redis** (port 6379) - for autocomplete caching
- **Search Service** (port 50051) - gRPC ranking engine
- **Query API** (port 8000) - HTTP gateway with spell correction
- **Frontend** (port 5173) - React search interface

### Step 5: Search!

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

You now have a fully functional search engine! Try searching for:
- `mathematics` - broad topic with many results
- `philosophy` - another well-covered area
- `computer science` - technical content
- `logic` - interdisciplinary topic

### Quick Development Setup

For development, you can also run services individually:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Search Service
cd services/search && go run .

# Terminal 2 - Query API
cd services/query-api && python -m uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 3 - Frontend
cd webapp && npm run dev
```

**Note:** Make sure Redis is running (`docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine`) for autocomplete to work.

## Configuration

The system requires several environment variables for proper operation. Here's a comprehensive guide to configuring each service:

### Core Storage Configuration

These credentials are needed by both the **Crawler** and **Indexer** services:

```bash
# MongoDB connection (for document metadata)
MONGO_CONNECTION='mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority'

# Cloudflare R2 / MinIO configuration (for raw HTML storage)
MINIO_ENDPOINT='your-r2-endpoint.r2.cloudflarestorage.com'
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY='your-access-key'
MINIO_SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
```

### Service-Specific Configuration

#### 1. Crawler Service
**Location**: `services/crawler/start.sh`

```bash
export MONGO_CONNECTION='your-mongodb-connection-string'
export MINIO_ENDPOINT='your-r2-endpoint.r2.cloudflarestorage.com'
export MINIO_ACCESS_KEY='your-access-key'
export MINIO_SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
```

**What it does**:
- `MONGO_CONNECTION`: Stores document metadata (title, URL, content length, first paragraph, images)
- `MINIO_*`: Stores raw HTML content using content hash as filename
- Crawler will create buckets automatically if they don't exist

#### 2. Indexer Service
**Location**: `services/indexer/start.sh`

```bash
export MONGO_CONNECTION='your-mongodb-connection-string'
export MINIO_ENDPOINT='your-r2-endpoint.r2.cloudflarestorage.com'
export MINIO_ACCESS_KEY='your-access-key'
export MINIO_SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
```

**What it does**:
- Reads crawled HTML from MinIO/R2 storage
- Fetches document metadata from MongoDB
- Builds inverted index and stores it locally in BadgerDB (`./tmp/badger/`)

#### 3. Query API Service (Python FastAPI)
**Environment variables** (set in docker-compose or runtime):

```bash
REDIS_HOST=localhost          # Redis host for autocomplete cache
REDIS_PORT=6379              # Redis port
SEARCH_HOST=localhost        # Search service gRPC host
SEARCH_PORT=50051           # Search service gRPC port
```

**What it does**:
- `REDIS_*`: Connects to Redis for autocomplete n-gram storage and query caching
- `SEARCH_*`: Connects to the Go search service via gRPC for ranking

#### 4. Search Service (Go gRPC)
**No additional environment variables needed**

- Reads from local BadgerDB index (built by indexer)
- Serves gRPC requests on port `50051`
- Uses LRU cache for query results (1000 entries by default)

#### 5. Frontend (React)
**Environment variables**:

```bash
VITE_QUERY_API_URL=http://localhost:8000    # Query API endpoint
```

**What it does**:
- `VITE_QUERY_API_URL`: Points to the Query API service for search requests

### Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` automatically sets up:

- **Redis**: Port 6379, with persistent volume
- **Service networking**: All services can communicate using service names
- **Volume mounting**: BadgerDB data persisted in `search_data` volume
- **Environment injection**: Automatically sets service discovery variables

### Configuration Files

#### BM25 Ranking Parameters
**Location**: `services/search/search.go`

```go
var K = 2.0    // Term frequency saturation point
var B = 0.9    // Field length normalization (0=no normalization, 1=full)
```

#### Crawler Seed URLs
**Location**: `services/crawler/config.go`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The example configuration files contain placeholder credentials.
